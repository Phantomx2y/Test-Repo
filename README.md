# My Public Repository

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my first public repository on GitHub!  
I created it to share ideas, code, and resources with the community.

## What's inside?
- README file (you are here âœ…)
- LICENSE file (open source rules)
- .gitignore (keeps repos clean)

ðŸŒŸ *Feel free to explore and connect with me on GitHub!*
